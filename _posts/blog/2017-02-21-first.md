I've been meaning to get around to this for a while, but some recent
suggestions from a couple people at work have finally prompted me to start
putting down some thoughts/ideas about how I work to be able to help others get
bootstrapped.

I plan to put random things here about the way I work and the tools I use. Feel
free to steal/ignore anything you want, but hopefully this can be a bit of use
to someone.
